Tailwind is utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Tailwind classes can be utilized by adding the class directly to HTML. There is no need to declare the class in a css document since they are already declared on tailwind. [Refer Tailwind documentation.](https://tailwindcss.com/)
